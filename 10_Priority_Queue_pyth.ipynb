        "A priority queue is an abstract data type that is similar to a regular queue or stack, but where each element has a \"priority\" associated with it.

        "\n",

        "   - Explain the heap property for both types\n",
        "   - How to convert between them (e.g., negating the priorities)\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **How would you implement a max priority queue using a min priority queue library?**\n",
        "   - Negate the priorities when inserting and extracting\n",

        "## Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Priority Queue Fundamentals**\n",
        "   - An abstract data type where each element has a priority\n",
        "   - Elements with higher priority are served before elements with lower priority\n",
        "   - Two main types: min priority queue and max priority queue\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Core Operations**\n",
        "   - **insert(item, priority)**: Add an item with priority - O(log n) with binary heap\n",
        "   - **delete_min()/delete_max()**: Remove highest priority item - O(log n) with binary heap\n",
        "   - **peek_min()/peek_max()**: View highest priority item without removing - O(1) with binary heap\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Implementation Approaches**\n",
        "   - **Unordered Array**: Fast insertions (O(1)), slow deletions (O(n))\n",
        "   - **Sorted Array**: Slow insertions (O(n)), fast deletions (O(1))\n",
        "   - **Binary Heap**: Balanced performance for all operations (O(log n))\n",
        "   - **Advanced Heaps**: Specialized implementations for specific use cases\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Binary Heap Structure**\n",
        "   - Complete binary tree with heap property\n",
        "   - Typically implemented using arrays\n",
        "   - Parent-child relationships defined by indices\n",
        "   - Balance between efficiency and simplicity\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Wide Range of Applications**\n",
        "   - **Graph Algorithms**: Dijkstra's, Prim's, A*\n",
        "   - **Data Compression**: Huffman coding\n",
        "   - **Operating Systems**: Process scheduling\n",
        "   - **Data Processing**: K-way merge, top K elements, median finding\n",
        "   - **Optimization Problems**: Task scheduling, resource allocation\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Advanced Variations**\n",
        "   - **Double-ended Priority Queue**: Efficient access to both min and max\n",
        "   - **Indexed Priority Queue**: Direct access to elements by key\n",
        "   - **Fibonacci Heap**: Theoretical optimization for some operations\n",
        "   - **Concurrent Priority Queue**: Thread-safe implementations\n",
        "\n",
        "## Best Practices\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Choosing the Right Implementation**\n",
        "   - For simple use cases, use a binary heap\n",
        "   - For frequent decrease-key operations, consider Fibonacci or pairing heaps\n",
        "   - For frequent lookups, use an indexed priority queue\n",
        "   - For multi-threaded environments, use concurrent priority queues\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Performance Optimization**\n",
        "   - Use `heapify` for batch construction instead of individual insertions\n",
        "   - Consider lazy deletion for complex removal patterns\n",
        "   - Minimize heap size when dealing with large datasets\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Python-Specific Tips**\n",
        "   - Leverage the built-in `heapq` module for most use cases\n",
        "   - Use tuples with additional fields for tie-breaking\n",
        "   - Negate priorities to convert between min and max heaps\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**\n",
        "   - Modifying an element's priority without proper reheapification\n",
        "   - Using complex objects as priorities without proper comparison methods\n",
        "   - Ignoring stability concerns for equal priorities\n",
        "   - Using the wrong heap type (min vs max) for the problem\n",
        "\n",
        "## When to Use Priority Queues\n",
        "\n",
        "**Use priority queues when**:\n",
        "- You need to process items in order of priority\n",
        "- You need to repeatedly access the min/max element\n",
        "- You have a streaming problem where you maintain a subset of items\n",
        "- You need to efficiently implement greedy algorithms\n",
        "\n",
        "**Consider alternatives when**:\n",
        "- You need fast access to arbitrary elements (use hash tables)\n",
        "- You need to search by value (use binary search trees)\n",
        "- The dataset is small (use simpler data structures)\n",
        "- The priorities never change (consider sorting once upfront)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Final Thoughts\n",
        "\n",
        "Priority queues are one of the most versatile and widely used data structures in computer science. Understanding their properties, implementations, and applications is essential for solving a wide range of algorithmic problems efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "By choosing the right priority queue implementation for your specific problem and understanding the performance trade-offs, you can significantly optimize your algorithms and develop more efficient solutions.\n"
